This web mapping application was created to display several locations in North Carolina where gold has been found. The state of North Carolina has a rich history with gold in the piedmont and mountain regions. Gold was first discovered in North Carolina in 1799 by a 12-year-old boy in Mecklenburg County. Many people don't know that NC was the highest gold producing state from that point until the California gold rush of 1849. In fact, North Carolina was the only gold producing state until 1828. Production of gold has decreased significantly and now is only a byproduct of copper mining in the Blue Ridge Mountains. This map is to be used along with an article published by the NCDEQ (https://deq.nc.gov/about/divisions/energy-mineral-land-resources/north-carolina-geological-survey/geoscience-education/gold-of-nc) to educate the public about North Carolina's golden history. Each golden dot represents a mine or creek where gold has historically been found. Users may interact with this map by zooming at different levels and clicking on a gold location to learn its name.
